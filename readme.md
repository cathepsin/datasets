<h1>helical.txt</h1>
<p>A dataset containing a filtered version of the PDB. Included sequences are those that have at least one alpha-helix of 30 residues or more,
  according to their <a href=https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/gv/dssp/>DSSP output</a></p></p>
<h1>helical_small.txt</h1>
<p>A dataset containing a filtered version of the PDB. Included sequences are those that have at least one alpha-helix of 30 residues or more,
  according to their <a href=https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/gv/dssp/>DSSP output</a>.
  About half of the potential sequences are arbitrarily removed to help tokenization run faster.</p>
<h1>percent70.txt</h1>
<p>A dataset containing a filtered version of the PDB. Included sequences are those where 70% or more of the residues in a single sequence are 
  a part of an alpha helix, according to their <a href=https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/gv/dssp/>DSSP output</a></p>
<h1>percent_below10.txt</h1>
<p>A dataset containing a filtered version of the PDB. Included sequences are those where no more than 10% of the residues in a single sequence
  are a part of an alpha helix, according to their <a href=https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/gv/dssp/>DSSP output</a></p>
